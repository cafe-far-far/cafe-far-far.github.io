# Project Title: Cafe Far Far

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to create an online ordering system for the Farley Hall cafe, Cafe Far Far, so that residents can place orders, and staff can view/fill the orders. When operational, Cafe Far Far only accepts walk-in orders at the current time and requires the customer to wait inside until the order is completed. Giving customers and staff the option to put this process online will hopefully increase the amount of sales made from this dorm cafe.


## Project Usefulness

This project will allow residents to order from their dorm room (or anywhere on campus), streamlining the ordering process and reducing the amount of time spent waiting for waffles to be cooked. While the cafe is not operational at the current time due to the coronavirus pandemic, this will be a great system to introduce next semester for residents of the hall.

## Project Realness

 Data includes the cafeâ€™s menu items and prices, which can be obtained from the residence hall. Additional user data (name, net id, etc.) can be inputted by the users themselves.


## Basic Functions

- **Insert:** customers will be able to place an order to be added to the database
- **Update:** customers will be able to make changes to their order, but this feature may potentially lock after a certain amount of time or be controlled by staff members (admins) to avoid changes occurring too late after orders
- **Delete:** customers and admins will be able to cancel orders, although similar to update this might be restricted to customers in certain scenarios
- **Search:** admins will be able to search for customers and their orders

## Advanced Functions

- **Estimated Time**: staff will be able to input an estimated time of food preparation to be added to a given order, which should be updated in the database so that the user can view the stat as well.
- **Personalized Orders**: users will be able to save details of previous orders to streamline the ordering process in the future. Details saved will include Menu item(s) and customization of the item(s).
